# smart_media_detector

Identifies platform, era, and (when possible) title from a disk image file or a
directory, using a five-tier detection pipeline that trades off confidence against
how much it has to inspect. Built to eventually be vendored out into its own
standalone package once Peach 1UP reaches Beta, so it is kept mostly free of
project-specific imports (see "Standalone-package intent" below for the current
state of that goal, including the places it still falls short).

## What it does

Given a path, `detect()` returns a `ScanResult` with `title`, `platform`, `era`,
`confidence` (0.0 to 1.0), a human-readable `reason`, an optional `requires_install`
flag, and a list of `warnings`. It never raises, even on a garbage or unreadable
path, it always returns a `ScanResult` with `confidence=0.0` and an explanatory
reason instead.

## Detection pipeline

Detection runs in tier order and stops at the first confident match. This matches
`dev_docs/TECH.md`'s documented description with no drift in pipeline structure.

1. **Hash lookup** (`hashing/hash_lookup.py`), full-file SHA-1, with MD5 and
   CRC32 fallback, checked against the bundled `hashing/hash_index.json`. A SHA-1
   hit returns `confidence=1.0` and exits immediately. CHD containers are a special
   case, see below.
2. **Magic bytes** (`magic/magic_detect.py`, driven by `magic/magic_signatures.toml`),
   file header compared against known signatures at fixed offsets. Covers PS1,
   PS2 (ambiguous with PS1 until resolved by SYSTEM.CNF), Dreamcast (GD-ROM),
   N64, and NES signatures.
3. **Structural validation**, a deeper, format-specific parse:
   - ISO (`iso_detect.py`): reads the ISO 9660 PVD at sector 16 for volume label,
     publisher, and system-ID fields, then falls back to scanning the root
     directory for a `.xbe` entry (Original Xbox).
   - CHD (`validators/chd_validator.py`): walks the CHD v5 metadata chain, a
     `CHGD` tag means Dreamcast, `CHTR`/`CHT2` means a standard CD/DVD track,
     PS1 vs PS2 is then guessed from the header's logical (uncompressed) size,
     since the CHTR/CHT2 tag alone does not distinguish PS1 from PS2.
   - BIN/CUE (`validators/bin_validator.py`, `iso_detect.detect_cue`): resolves
     the `.cue` sheet to its `.bin` sibling, then reruns the magic-byte and PVD
     checks against the binary. Falls back to the cue sheet's declared track
     type (`MODE1/2352`, `MODE2/2352`, `AUDIO`) as a low-confidence secondary
     signal if magic bytes do not resolve it.
4. **Directory heuristics** (`directory_detect.py`), for folder-based items:
   checks `AUTORUN.INF` for a pointed-to PE executable first (parsing its PE
   header for OS version and subsystem), then falls back to root-level marker
   files (`I386`/`XPSP` for XP, `WIN98`/`WIN95` marker files, `SYSTEM.CNF` for
   PS1/PS2 with BOOT vs BOOT2 key resolution), then depth-2 scans for DOS
   decompression tools, `.WAD` files, split archives, and DOS-only extension
   sets.
5. **Extension / size fallback**, lowest-confidence tier. Used when nothing
   structural matched: file extension alone for `.xiso`, `.z64`/`.n64`/`.v64`,
   `.sfc`/`.smc`/`.fig`/`.swc`, `.nes`, plus extension combined with file size
   for ambiguous `.img` and `.iso` files.

PE executables (`.exe` files and files pointed to by `AUTORUN.INF`) are handled
by `exe_detect.py` and `directory_detect.py` respectively, both read the PE
header's `MajorOperatingSystemVersion` and (for autorun) `Subsystem` fields to
distinguish Windows 98 era from Windows XP era.

`_compute_requires_install()` in `detector.py` is a separate heuristic, applied
after era detection, that flags DOS-era installer media (raw `.iso`/`.cue`,
small `.img` files, or a directory whose only root-level executables are all on
the install/setup blocklist in `utils/blocklist.py`).

## How to use it

The package's public surface, per `__init__.py`, is six names: `detect`,
`ScanResult`, `verify`, `VerifyResult`, `classify`, and `ClassifyResult`.

```python
from backend.service.utils.smart_media_detector import detect, ScanResult

scan: ScanResult = detect(Path("/path/to/some.iso"))
if scan.era is not None:
    ...  # scan.title, scan.platform, scan.confidence, scan.reason, scan.requires_install
```

This is how every real caller in the codebase uses `detect()`, always via a
local `import ... as _smart_detect` inside the calling function rather than a
module-level import (`backend/service/games/items.py`,
`backend/service/utils/drive_utils.py`,
`backend/api/routes/game_item_bundles.py`). Callers check `scan.era` for
`None` to decide whether detection succeeded, and separately inspect
`scan.warnings` for logging even on a successful low-confidence match.

### verify(), hash-only re-check, separate from detect()

`verify(path, expected_sha1) -> VerifyResult` (`verify.py`) is a second,
narrower entry point, kept deliberately separate from `detect()`. It never
runs the magic-byte/structural/directory/fallback tiers, it only hashes
*path* and looks the result up in `hash_index.json`, mirroring how
`bios_placement.py` already uses `hash_file()` directly today (see below).
Use it to re-check a file already identified by `detect()` at some earlier
point, not to identify an unknown file for the first time, that is still
`detect()`'s job.

```python
from backend.service.utils.smart_media_detector import verify, VerifyResult

result: VerifyResult = verify(Path("/path/to/some.iso"), expected_sha1="…")
result.status  # "matched" | "mismatched" | "not_in_index"
```

`VerifyResult.status` distinguishes three outcomes:

- `"matched"`, the file's current sha1 is present in `hash_index.json` and
  equals *expected_sha1*.
- `"mismatched"`, the file's current sha1 is present in `hash_index.json`
  but does not equal *expected_sha1* (the file changed since the hash was
  recorded, e.g. corruption or a swapped file).
- `"not_in_index"`, the file's current sha1 is not present in
  `hash_index.json` at all. Deliberately distinct from `"mismatched"`, this
  means the index has no opinion on the file at all, not that it disagrees
  with a prior recorded hash.

### classify(), five-state verification, no prior expected_sha1 needed

`classify(path, title, era, threshold=0.80) -> ClassifyResult` (`classify.py`)
is the third entry point, used for Peach 1UP's persisted `GameItem.verification_status`
field (five states, see `backend/models/game.py`). Unlike `verify()`, it needs
no prior expected hash, it establishes a classification from scratch, so it
is used both at ingest (one call per disc, see `backend/service/games/items.py`)
and for a from-scratch manual re-check.

```python
from backend.service.utils.smart_media_detector import classify, ClassifyResult

result: ClassifyResult = classify(Path("/path/to/some.iso"), title="Halo", era="xbox")
result.status  # "verified" | "caution" | "mismatch" | "not_in_index" | "unchecked"
```

`ClassifyResult.status` distinguishes five outcomes, checked in this order:

1. `"verified"`, sha1 (or, for a `.chd`, its embedded rawsha1) exactly
   matches a `hash_index.json` entry. Highest confidence, the only state
   that should ever read as a positive confirmation.
2. `"caution"`, no sha1 match, but md5 or crc32 exactly matches an entry.
   Real index coverage, weaker confidence than a sha1 hit. Skipped entirely
   for `.chd` (its raw md5/crc32 are as meaningless as its raw sha1, same
   reasoning as `hash_lookup.lookup()`).
3. `"mismatch"`, no hash of any kind matched, but *title* is an approximate
   match (`hashing/title_match.py`, stdlib `difflib.SequenceMatcher`,
   *threshold* similarity ratio, 0.80 default) for a title that does exist
   in `hash_index.json`, scoped to *era*. Expected to happen often against
   an inherently incomplete public hash catalog, not itself a sign the file
   is bad, and it is deliberately conservative: an ambiguous or
   below-threshold title match never produces it, that falls through to
   `"not_in_index"` instead. *era* is required for this tier, a `None`/unknown
   era skips the fuzzy check entirely (fails closed) rather than searching
   every platform's titles, which would make an accidental false-positive
   match more likely, not less.
4. `"not_in_index"`, no hash matched and no confident title match either.
   Neutral, "we have no data on this file", not a warning.
5. `"unchecked"`, the file could not be hashed at all (missing, unreadable,
   permission error). No classification was possible.

`ClassifyResult.computed_sha1` is the file's own raw sha1, persisted whenever
hashing succeeds regardless of status (`None` only for `"unchecked"`). This
is the value Peach 1UP persists as `GameItem.sha1`, its own re-check baseline
for a later `classify()` call, never returned by any API response, see
`dev_docs/TYPES.md` §4 for that guarantee.

### hash_file(), the lower-level primitive detect(), verify(), and classify() all share

A fourth function is used directly by callers, bypassing the package's public
`__init__.py`, since it is a general-purpose hashing utility rather than a
detection, verification, or classification call: `hash_file(path) -> dict`
from `hashing/hash_lookup.py`, which returns `{"sha1": ..., "md5": ...,
"crc32": ...}`. `backend/service/utils/bios_placement.py` imports this
directly to verify a placed BIOS file's SHA-1 against a known-good hash.
`verify()` and `classify()` above are both built on this same primitive.

## Where the hash source data comes from

`hash_index.json` is generated offline from DAT files published by preservation
communities, not fetched or generated at runtime.

- **Redump** (redump.org) publishes per-disc DATs (XML, `<game name=...><rom
  sha1= md5= crc=>`) for CD/DVD-based console platforms. Downloads are at
  redump.org/downloads, organized by platform. No login or authentication is
  required to browse or download.
- **No-Intro** (no-intro.org, or the community wiki/datomatic front ends) publishes
  the equivalent DAT format for cartridge-based platforms. Same schema shape,
  same no-auth download model.

Both formats are parsed by the same code path, `hashing/dat_parser.py` reads
`<header><name>` for a platform hint and iterates every `<game>/<rom>` element,
so a single parser handles DATs from either source, or from TOSEC, which uses a
compatible schema. `_ERA_MARKERS` in `dat_parser.py` maps the platform-name
string to an era slug: `playstation 2` to `ps2`, `playstation` to `ps1`,
`xbox` to `xbox`, and `dreamcast` to `dreamcast` are confirmed against real
Redump DAT header text. `super nintendo entertainment system` to `snes`,
`nintendo entertainment system` to `nes`, and `nintendo 64` to `n64` follow
No-Intro's standard naming convention but have not been verified against an
actual downloaded No-Intro DAT. There is deliberately no mapping for
`ibm pc compatible`, see Current coverage state below for why. None of the
confirmed mappings add any actual rows to `hash_index.json` today, they only
affect how a future DAT for these platforms would resolve once ingested.

### Turning a new DAT into index entries today

The process is entirely manual, there is no ingestion automation:

```bash
python -m backend.service.utils.smart_media_detector.hashing.build_index \
    --dats <directory-of-dat-files> [--output <path>] [--rebuild]
```

This walks `--dats` recursively for `*.dat`/`*.xml` files, parses each with
`dat_parser.parse_dat()`, and merges new entries into the existing
`hash_index.json` (or wipes and rebuilds it, if `--rebuild` is passed). One
detail worth knowing before feeding it a new DAT source: entries are only
added if the parsed record has a `sha1` value, a DAT that supplies only
`md5`/`crc32` per entry will parse without error but contribute zero rows to
the index, since `build_index.py`'s indexing key is SHA-1 only (MD5/CRC32 are
still stored per-entry for the secondary lookup tiers, just not usable as the
primary key for new records that lack SHA-1). This is no longer a silent
failure mode: `build_index.py` now logs a warning per DAT file with skipped
records, prints a "Records skipped (no sha1)" count in the run summary, and
logs a final warning with the total skipped count across all parsed DATs, so
a run against an MD5/CRC32-only DAT surfaces the problem instead of quietly
producing zero new entries.

## Loading the index into the database (Peach 1UP only)

`hash_index.json` also has a Peach-1UP-specific consumer outside this
package: `scripts/ingest_hash_index.py` reads it and upserts every entry into
a `hash_index_entries` DB table (`backend/models/hash_index.py`,
`HashIndexEntry`) for callers that want to query confirmed hashes via SQL
instead of loading the JSON file directly. Run it manually after
regenerating `hash_index.json`:

```bash
python -m scripts.ingest_hash_index [--index <path>]
```

Refer to the [Peach 1UP](https://github.com/rymorrisj/peach_1up) project if you are
interested in how we do that *or if you are passionate about perseving your media!*

It is idempotent (upsert by `sha1`, existing rows updated in place, nothing
wiped) and standalone (not called from any startup/lifespan hook or from
this package). This package has no knowledge of the script, the DB table, or
SQLModel, and never will — it stays storage-agnostic per the
"Standalone-package intent" section below. Nothing in this package's own
code path (`detect()`, `hash_lookup.py`) reads from that table; both consume
`hash_index.json` independently.

## Current coverage state

As of this writing, `hash_index.json` has confirmed entries for exactly two
platforms:

- **Sony PlayStation** (era `ps1`), sourced from a Redump PlayStation datfile.
- **Microsoft Xbox** (era `xbox`), sourced from a Redump Xbox datfile.

Every other era in `config/constants.yaml`'s `eras` list, `win95`, `win98`,
`winxp`, `ps2`, `nes`, `snes`, `n64`, and `dreamcast`, has zero hash-index
coverage. This is a real gap against what the pipeline and this document
otherwise imply: the magic-byte table already has signatures for `n64`,
`nes`, and `dreamcast`, and the structural/directory tiers already have logic
paths for `ps2`, `win95`, `win98`, and `winxp`, but none of those eras can
currently reach tier-1 (hash-confirmed, `confidence=1.0`) identification.
Detection for those eras today relies entirely on tiers 2 through 5.
`_ERA_MARKERS` now has mappings ready for `nes`, `snes`, and `n64` (see above),
but that only means a future No-Intro DAT for those platforms would resolve
correctly once ingested, `hash_index.json` itself still has zero rows for
them today.

A second, separate known gap: PC software (DOS/Windows game and application
discs) has no clean hash source integrated at all. Redump does publish an
"IBM PC compatible" DAT category that would be the natural fit, it has not
been added to the index. This is not simply a matter of adding one mapping
line the way NES/SNES/N64 were, Redump ships one PC disc DAT category that
covers DOS and Windows 95/98/XP era CD software together, so the platform-name
string alone cannot tell those eras apart the way it can for the console
entries. `_ERA_MARKERS` deliberately has no mapping for `ibm pc compatible`,
a PC DAT parses cleanly today but every record from it carries `era=None`,
the same safe default any other unmapped platform name gets, rather than a
wrong but confident era. A real per-title resolution strategy, inspecting
individual DAT game entries for sub-platform hints rather than relying on the
shared header name, is needed before this platform can reach tier-1 hash
coverage at all. PC-era detection today runs entirely on PVD publisher/
volume-label heuristics (`iso_detect.py`) and directory heuristics, never on
a hash match.

## Standalone-package intent

The package is written to eventually be extracted into its own repository,
`__init__.py` exposes a minimal two-name surface (`detect`, `ScanResult`), and
the bulk of the code, `detector.py`'s dispatch logic, `magic/`, `validators/`,
`iso_detect.py`, `exe_detect.py`, `directory_detect.py`, and the hashing
pipeline, has no dependency on the rest of Peach 1UP. That said, a few things
would need cleanup before extraction is actually clean:

- `detector.py` imports `backend.core.logger` for its module logger. Small,
  but it is a real `backend.*` import inside the package today, this is the
  one remaining `backend.*` import in the package.
- `iso_detect.py` imports `from ..xbox_image import is_xiso`, a sibling
  module at `backend/service/utils/xbox_image.py`, one directory above this
  package. It has no `backend.*` imports itself, but it lives outside
  `smart_media_detector/`, so it would need to move into the package (or be
  vendored as a copy) before extraction.
- `utils/file_helpers.py` (unused `get_compatible_media()`, three `backend.*`
  imports) and the stub `validators/iso_validator.py`/`validators/rom_validator.py`
  files (`raise NotImplementedError`, never imported anywhere) have since been
  removed as dead code, they are noted here only so the history of this
  cleanup isn't lost.

No packaging scaffolding (`pyproject.toml`, `setup.py`, version metadata, its
own test runner config) exists yet inside this directory, extraction has not
been started beyond the import-hygiene intent described above.

## Known limitations

- Xbox OG ISOs without `DEFAULT.XBE` at the ISO root will not resolve via the
  structural `.xbe` scan, the magic-byte tier still applies as a fallback.
  Standard Xbox rips typically include `DEFAULT.XBE` at the root, so this is
  expected to be rare in practice.
- `.bin`/`.cue` pairs without a matching `.cue` sibling return low confidence
  and a warning, the scanner cannot resolve CD layout without a cue sheet.
- The `requires_install` heuristic (DOS/Windows installer-only directory
  detection) is approximate, it checks whether every root-level executable
  is on the install/setup blocklist. May need tuning based on real-world
  testing.

We do our best to sanitize, clean up and parse all datfiles we use but there 
may be some inaccurcies with detection for various reasons. Always, check the files
