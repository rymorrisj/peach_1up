    """A resolved, launchable media shape, produced once by a resolver in this
    package (resolve_ps3_target, resolve_xex_target) and consumed by both the
    ingest/detection layer and a launch backend, instead of each independently
    re-deriving the same folder-shape logic (see backend.service.backends.rpcs3
    and backend.service.backends.xenia for the two consumers).

    kind:
        "file", a single launchable file, no folder-shape resolution needed.
        "disc_folder", a folder identified by a disc-format structural marker
            (e.g. PS3_DISC.SFB); RPCS3's own "Boot Game" walks the folder
            itself, not a resolved boot file.
        "installed_dir", a folder with no disc marker but a resolvable boot
            file at a known relative layout (e.g. dev_hdd0/game/<ID>/USRDIR/EBOOT.BIN).
        "xex_folder", an extracted Xbox 360 folder resolved to its bootable
            .xex file.

    detect_path: what classify()/hash_file() should hash for verification.
        For "disc_folder"/"installed_dir" this is the resolved boot file
        (e.g. EBOOT.BIN), not the folder, a folder can never be hashed.
    launch_path: what gets handed to the emulator. For "disc_folder"/
        "installed_dir" this is the folder itself (RPCS3 does its own
        internal walk); for "xex_folder" and "file" it is the same file as
        detect_path.
    license_files: sibling license files discovered alongside a "file"-kind
        target (today: .rap files next to a PS3 .pkg). Empty for every other
        kind.

    """Five-state verification classification for a single file, combining
    exact hash-tier lookup (sha1/md5/crc32) with a fuzzy title-match fallback.
    Unlike verify(), this needs no prior expected_sha1, it establishes a
    classification from scratch, used both at ingest and on a manual re-check.

    status:
        "verified", sha1 (or, for a CHD container, its embedded rawsha1)
            exactly matches a hash_index.json entry. Highest confidence, the
            only state that should ever read as a positive confirmation.
        "caution", no sha1 match, but md5 or crc32 exactly matches an entry.
            Real index coverage, weaker confidence than a sha1 hit.
        "mismatch", no hash of any kind matched, but the title is an
            approximate (>=threshold) match for a title that does exist in
            hash_index.json. Expected to happen often against an inherently
            incomplete public hash catalog, not itself a sign the file is
            bad. Deliberately conservative, an ambiguous or below-threshold
            title match never produces this state, it falls through to
            "not_in_index" instead. A false "mismatch" must never fire.
        "not_in_index", no hash matched and no confident title match either.
            Neutral, "we have no data on this file", not a warning.
        "unchecked", the file could not be hashed at all (missing, unreadable,
            permission error). No classification was possible.

    computed_sha1 is the file's own raw sha1 (hash_file()'s result), persisted
    whenever hashing succeeds, regardless of which status was reached. It is
    None only for "unchecked". This is not the embedded CHD rawsha1 used
    internally for the verified-tier lookup, a caller needing that value
    should use validators.chd_validator.extract_embedded_sha1 directly.

    matched_title/similarity are populated only for "mismatch": the specific
    index title the fuzzy match landed on and its similarity ratio, useful
    for logging, not required for handling the status itself.
